## Internal API (aka *Voyager*)
### Query String Syntax
One common way that different pieces of information are requested from Voyager is simply by using different endpoints; `/me` for information about the logged-in user, `/identity/profiles/.../skillCategory` for skills, etc.

However, certain endpoints have advanced filtering in place, where there is another layer of passing request data - through the **query string**. The syntax and nature of filtering sort of feels like GraphQL or something like that. Especially since these endpoints will sometimes even return `schema` info, which describes the shape of the actual data that is being returned.

The syntax varies, but as of 2020, the more advanced filtered endpoints usually look like this:

`{endpoint}/?q={authOrObjectOfInterest}&authOrObjectOfInterest={authOrObjectOfInterest_VALUE}&decorationId={schemaFilter}`

To break this down further:

 - `q={authOrObjectOfInterest}`
     - This can be either *who* is authorizing the request (e.g. `admin`, `viewee`, etc.), or *what* the request is about (e.g. `memberIdentity`, if about another LI user)
 - `authOrObjectOfInterest={authOrObjectOfInterest_VALUE}`
     - If the endpoint uses the `q=` param (described above), the value for the query is usually passed by repeating the `authOrObjectOfInterest` string, as part of a new param key-pair.
     - For example, if the first part of the query string was `q=memberIdentity`, then the next part might be `&memberIdentity=joshuatz`. This says that the query is about a member, with the ID of `joshuatz`.
 - `decorationId={schemaFilter}`
     - For endpoints that are *generic* base endpoints, and rely heavily on schema filtering, this property is extremely important. Unfortunately, it is also extremely un-documented....
     - `schemaFilter` is a string, written with dot notation, which looks like some sort of nested namespace. E.g. `com.linkedin.voyager.dash.deco.identity.profile.PrimaryLocale-3`


> For some endpoints, only `decorationId` is required, and the other query parameters are completely omitted. Keep in mind that LI knows who is making the request based on the Auth headers.

### Paging Data
#### Paging in Requests
The usual paging querystring parameters are:

 - `count={number}`
     - I think most APIs would call this `limit` instead
 - `start={number}`

#### Paging in Responses
LI usually responds with paging data in every response, regardless if there is enough entities to need paging anyways. Paging data can be returned at multiple levels; at both the root level (for the *thing* you requested), as well as at multiple nested sub-levels (for *children* of the *thing* you requested).

The paging information object usually looks like this:

```ts
type PagingInfo = {
    count: number;
    start: number;
    total?: number;
    $recipeTypes?: string[];
    // I've never actually seen this property populated...
    // This is probably actually `Array<com.linkedin.restli.common.Link>`
    links?: string[];
}
```

> Note that several paging properties are often omitted.

### Dash Endpoint(s)
As a quick side-note, I've noticed that a lot of the endpoints with `dash` anywhere in the path use the newer `decorationId` query syntax. This seems to also correspond with a shift in LI's UI towards true SPA functionality, where more of the page is lazy-loaded with filtered data that is slotted into Ember JS templates.

### Voyager Responses and Nested Data
Here are some quick notes on Voyager responses and how data is grouped / nested:

 - *Elements* can be nested several layers deep; you might have an initial collection of elements, where each sub-element is actually a group that contains pointer to further collections of elements
     - If you want to get the final layer of elements, you have to be careful about how you get them
        - If you simply filter by `$type`, you are going to get elements out of order, and LI does not provide indexes (typically) on elements
        - The only way to preserve the true order (which will match the rendered result on LI) is to traverse through levels
     - Currently, `com.linkedin.restli.common.CollectionResponse` seems to be used for each layer where the element is a collection that points to sub elements (under `*elements`) key
     - This can also make paging a little messy.
 - LI has limits on certain endpoints, and the amount of nested elements it will return
     - See [PR #23](https://github.com/joshuatz/linkedin-to-jsonresume/pull/23) for an example of how this was implemented

### Voyager - Misc Notes
 - Make sure you always include the `Host` header if making requests outside a web browser (browsers will automatically include this for you)
     - Value should be: `www.linkedin.com`
     - If you forget it, you will get 400 error (`invalid hostname`)
 - For inline data, `<code></code>` with request payload usually ***follows*** `<img><code></code>` with *response* payload
 - It appears as though whatever language the profile was ***first*** created with sticks as the "principal language", regardless if user changes language settings (more on this below).
     - You can find this under the main profile object, where you would find `supportedLocales` - the default / initial locale is under - `defaultLocale`

### Voyager - Multilingual and Locales Support
> LI seems to be making changes related to this; this section might not be 100% up-to-date.

There are some really strange quirks around multi-locale profiles. When a multi-locale user is logged in and requesting *their own* profile, LI will *refuse* to let the `x-li-lang` header override the `defaultLocale` as specified by the profile (see [issue #35](https://github.com/joshuatz/linkedin-to-jsonresume/issues/35)). However, if *someone else* exports their profile, the same exact endpoints will respect the header and will return the correct data for the requested locale (assuming creator made a version of their profile with the requested locale).

Even stranger, this quirk only seems to apply to *certain* endpoints; e.g. `/me` respects the requested language, but `/profileView` does not (and *always* returns data corresponding with `defaultLocale`) üôÉ

Furthermore, the `/dash` subset of endpoints does not ever (AFAIK) change the main key-value pairs based on `x-li-lang`; instead, it nests multi-locale data under `multiLocale` prefixed keys. For example:

```json
{
    "firstName": "–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µÃÅ–π",
    "multiLocaleFirstName": {
        "ru_RU": "–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µÃÅ–π",
        "en_US": "Alexey"
    }
}
```

## LinkedIn TS Types
I've put some basics LI types in my `global.d.ts`. Eventually, it would be nice to re-write the core of this project as TS, as opposed to the current VSCode-powered typed JS approached.
